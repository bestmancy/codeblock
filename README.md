# Code Block

>Repository for notes, information, etc. for UConn NBL's Code Block

This can be a central storage space for Code Block. If you're a member of the NBL
community (even if you never come to Code Block), you can contact me (Rachael)
for write access so you can add things if you'd like. Or submit a pull request.

The folders and topics and things that are here are just a starting placeâ€”if you
think something is missing, go ahead and add it! Or if you have questions, you can
[submit an issue](https://github.com/cranndarach/codeblock/issues).
